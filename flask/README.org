Assignment:
Create a flask web app. Your web app can present any data you want and
have any look you design but must include the following features:

- Multiple routes (at least 2)                      - DONE
- At least one form that you can submit. Your page should do something
  when you submit the form - minimally show the data. It is
  recommended that you do both the GET and POST for the form in the
  same route.                                       - DONE (login route)
- Use flask templates with substitutions            - DONE
- At least some CSS (either written yourself or you can use a library
  like bootstrap, tailwind etc.).                   - DONE
- At least one image                                - DONE             
- At least one form and a route                     - DONE
- At least one example of using the flask session.  - DONE ( using sessionStorage script in the index page)
